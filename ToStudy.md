# Optimization algorithms
    - Why is the best mini-batch size usually not 1 and not m, but instead something in-between?
    - Adam
    - Momentum

# Bird recognition in the city of Peacetopia
    - What's difference human-level perormance and Bayes error
    - What happens after decrease the regularization
    - You have more false negatives than other's algorithm, What will you do?
    ----------------------------------------------------------------
    > Rethink the appropriate metric for this task, and ask your team to tune to the new metric.
    ----------------------------------------------------------------
    - You have only 1,000 images of the new species of bird. The city expects a better system from you within the next 3 months. Which of these should you do first?
    ----------------------------------------------------------------
    > Use the data you have to define a new evaluation metric (using a new dev/test set) taking into account the new species, and use that to drive further progress for your team.

# Autonomous driving ( case study )
    - Multi-task Learning ?
